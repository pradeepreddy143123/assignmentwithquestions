Hi,
Description :


WAP - for the 4 departments of a super market : Sales, Purchase, Stock and SuperMarket in four different source code files.
Stock : Maintains a variable for available stock. updates to the variable will happen in this file through addstock and deletestock functions.

Sales : Has one function: Sell – It will decide if sales is possible by check if enough stock is available.

Purchase : Has one function : Purchase – will decide if purchase is possible.Set a max value for stock, before purchasing check if the stock room has enough space for new items or not.

SuperMarket main function : Display menu with choices : 1 ) check AvailableStock 2 ) Purchase new items 3) Sell items 4) Quit… this should be continuous as long as the user wants to continue. Program should stop when the user wants to quit.

Modify the version#1 to implement the below features:

1) Restrict stock variable to stock.c file.
2) When sales option is chosen:
if(stock < itemstosell)
Give options:
1) Sell available stock
2) Cancel the sales

3)When purchase option is chosen:
if(space< itemstopurchase)
Give options:
1) purchase the possible items for remaining space
2) Cancel the purchase

4) On Quit (Option 4)
Print the below report before stopping the program:
1) closing stock
2) No of sales
3) No of items sold
4) No of purchases
5) No of items purchased
6) No of customers visited

1) Write the following program :
Declare an integer array of size 100.
Assign numbers 1-100 to each element of the array.
Print all the numbers.
Print all even elements.
Print all odd elements.
Add 5 to each element and print 6 – 105 numbers.

2) Write the following program :
Declare a character array without size.
Initialize the array with characters of your name.
Print your name using for loop.

3) Declare an array of size 10. Enter 10 elements and save them in the array. Print the array . Find out the biggest and smallest numbers and print the biggest number and its position in the array, smallest number and its position in the array. Find both using a single loop.

4) Try experimenting with the below array syntaxes and see the results,check their sizes, try to also read values for elements and print them:
int arr[5] = {};
int arr[10] = {2.4,5.6,7.3};
int arr[3] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int arr[0] = {};
int arr[0] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int arr[] = {};
int arr[‘a’];"

5) Write a program to search for a specific element given by the user, in an array and display where it was found in the array (index).
If the element is available multiple times, then print all positions. also print how many times the element was repeated, at the end. Try to do it in a single loop. Make array size as a variable and take array size as input from the user.

eg., input array: 1 2 4 6 2 7 3 7 2 3
enter number to search: 7
output:
7 is found at 6th position
7 is found at 8th position

Pointers assignments :

1)Write a program to print the address of a variable , its value ,its size, try different executions and note the address printed. Assign the address of the variable to a pointer variable.Print the size of pointer and its indirected value (apply * operator).
2)Write a program to add two variables using thier pointers.
3)Write a program to take input for two character variables using pointers and find out which character has higher ascii value.
4)Declare 3 integer variables. Declare an integer pointer. Assign the address of each variable to the pointer in succession and print the value of the variable using indirection operator on the pointer.
5)Declare 3 pointer variables of integer type, and an integer variable. Assign the address of integer variable to the 3 pointers. Print the variable value using indirection on each pointer variable. Change the variable value directly and check the values of each of the pointers using indirection. Change the variable value , using each pointer and print the variable value and indirected values of all pointers every time you change.

e.g. if x = 10101010 (170 decimal) and y = 10100111 (167 decimal) and n = 3 and p = 6 then
you need to strip off 3 bits of y (111) and put them in x at position 10xxx010 to get answer
10111010. Your answer should print out the result in binary form although input can be in
decimal form.
Your output should be like this:
x = 10101010 (binary)
y = 10100111 (binary)
setbits n = 3, p = 6 gives x = 10111010 (binary).

to kernelmasterslab, kernelmasterslab1, bcc: me

1) Write a flow chart for the below problem and write program:

Write a program to input n numbers and print the largest and smallest numbers out of them.

Eg., 3,23,56,34,78,45,26,90,68,77
Biggest Number is 90
Smallest Number is 3

2) Declare an array of size 10. Enter 10 elements and save them in the array. Print the array . Find out the biggest and smallest numbers and their indexes and print.

Try to convert the size to a variable and do it for n elements of the array using variable sized 
arrays.

3) write a function that takes an array and its size as input and returns biggest number index as output. And print the biggest number based on the function call.

4) Create the array dynamically, read the data for the array, and use the above function in Q3 to find the biggest number in that array.

5) Write a search function that will take an array , its size and an element to search as inputs. Search that element in the array, and return the index of the found element. If not found, return -1.

Call this function to find the element in a statically created array. Use the same function to find an element in a dynamically created array.

6) Given an array of n integers where n>1, return an array of same size an input array where at every index of the output array should contain the product of all elements in the array except the element at the given index. print the array in calling function. Create this array in called function dynamically.
Example:
arr[] = {10, 4, 1, 6, 2}
prod[] = {48,120,480,80,240}

7) create an array dynamically, read data, and sort it and print it. Write a bubblesort function for that based on below steps.

•Run a nested loop. The outer loop will loop through n-1 times, if there are n elements to be sorted.
•The inner loop just compares adjacent elements and will swap them if they are not in correct order.
•Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are to be swapped.
Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
The above process goes on until the last element.
•The same process goes on for the remaining iterations. After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.
In each iteration, the comparison takes place up to the last unsorted element.
The array is sorted when all the unsorted elements are placed at their correct positions.
8) 
" Write a function that takes two sorted integer arrays as input, and returns an array of integers from both arrays in sorted order, excluding duplicate numbers. Arrays should not be sorted after merging. arrays should always stay sorted while they are being merged into another array.
Assume that the input arrays are sorted.
eg., array1 : 10,12,13,14,15,16
array2 : 9,12,15,19,20
output array3 : 9,10,12,13,14,15,16,19,20"

9) Implement your own itoa function and return the string from the function. Print the result in main.
eg., if input is 345 (integer) output should be a string "345" 
itoa function is a library function that converts a number to a numeric string.

10) 
Write a function, that takes two strings as input and concatenates only the first n characters from first string and first m characters from second string and makes a new string.
 eg., input str1 = "kernel masters", str2 = "raayan systems", n = 3, m = 5
 output : kerraaya

1)  "Write a trim() function,that will remove the leading and trailing spaces from a string.
eg., Input : ""    str  str   ""
Output : ""str str"""



2) Implement your own realloc function using malloc and free using below steps: 
- Allocate memory for new size using malloc
- copy data from old address to new address
- release the old address
- return the new address

3) Write a string concatenation function that calculates the source string length, accordingly adjusts the size of destination string before concatenating the strings, to avoid size issues. For this the destination must be allocated dynamically in calling function.

4)
read a set of words from the user and concatenate all of them to make a sentence and print it back using the concatenation function above with spaces as delimiters and fullstop as end of the sentence.

input: 
Kernel
Masters
is
India's
leading
training
institute.

output: Kernel Masters is India's leading training institute.

5) "Write a function that takes a main string and two sub strings (need not be same length), and replace every occurrence of first substring with the second substring in main string and return a new string as output.

eg., input : kernel  e   xxx

output: kxxxrnxxxl"

6) Write a program to read a set of strings from a user and print which string is the smallest of all ( in string comparison, smallest string means that should come the first in dictionary sorting order). Create the strings dynamically. 

7) read a set of numbers from the user, and convert each integer to string using itoa function that you have written yesterday, and print the numeric string in calling function in the same loop.

read only strings - character pointer [classnotes]
Inbox

Madhuri <kernelmasters@gmail.com>

String constants
• A string constant can be created by enclosing the string in double quotation marks and assigning it to a char pointer. The string constants are stored in read-only memory.
• The double quotation string is stored by default in read-only memory except for one situation, where you are using the string to initialize a char array.
• When the string is assigned to a pointer variable on left, the double quotation expression returns the based address of the string stored in read-only memory. Base address is nothing but the address of the first element of an array.

Eg., char *pstr = “Kernel”;

Char array vs string constant
A string can be represented in two ways, either using a character array or using a character pointer.
char str[10] = “Kernel”; // string is stored in writable memory in the memory allocated for str.
char * pstr = “Kernel”; // string is in read-only memory & its base address is stored in pstr.


Character array (char [])

char str[10] = “Kernel”;

Character array is a set of consecutively stored characters.
The initialized string is created in writable memory (stack or data segment).

We can access each character of the string separately using index,eg.,  str[0] means ‘K’.

We can modify each character separately.
Eg., str[0] = ‘R’ ; // works fine

Size of the character array variable is the number of bytes allocated for the string.
Eg., sizeof(str) here is 7.

Cannot assign a new string to the character array.
Eg., str = “Raayan”; //gives compilation error

Size of the array is fixed. So string length is limited.
Can take as user input using scanf.
scanf(“%s”,str); // works fine upto the size of the array



Character pointer (char *) initialized to a string constant

char * pstr = “Kernel”;
Character pointer is single pointer variable that stores the address of the first character of the string.

The initialized string is created in read-only section of data segment.

We can access each character of the string separately using index,eg., pstr[0] means ‘K’.


Cannot modify the individual characters.
Eg., pstr[0] = ‘R’; //gives runtime error

Size of the character pointer will be 4/8 (size of pointer).
Eg., sizeof(pstr) is 8.

Can assign a new string to the character pointer.
Eg., pstr = “Raayan”; //creates new string in read-only memory and assigns its base address to pstr.

Size of the read-only string can be anything. Since we are storing only based address in the pointer,string length is not limited like in array.

Need to initialize the pointer to some writable address, then only we can input some string.
Eg., char * pstr = str; //str is character array
scanf(“%s”,ptr);

Today we have covered structures revision, and how to access different types of members, using a structure pointer and structure variable. and how to create a structure dynamically. 

1) Practice scanf and printf on each member of the structure using a structure variable and a structure pointer, using the below structure template:


struct student
{
int ID;
char name[50];
int marks[6];
struct date dob, doj;
float  * per;
char * coursename;
struct date * dop;
};

create a structure variable of the above type and read ID , name and marks of 6 subjects, date of birth and date of joining using scanf and printf.
Then calculate percentage of marks, and store the percentage using per pointer member, and print it.

then assign some course name to coursename pointer and print it.

then do scanf and printf on date of placement (read date and print date).


do all these steps in one program.


2) Create the above structure dynamically, and repeat all steps given above, using the pointer.

3) Create an array for above structure dynamically, and repeat all steps for all elements of the array.

4	Create a new file using contents of two files.(append one file content to another, and write to a third file).
5	Two files data1 and data2 contain sorted list of integers. Write a program to produce a third file data which holds a single,sorted, merged list of these two files. Use command line arguments to specify the file names.
6	Write a program that compares two files and returns 0 if they are equal and 1 if they are not equal.
7	Write a program that reads a file containing integers and appends the sum of all integers at the end.
8	Write a program to write a set of characters to a file, and read and print the contents in reverse.
9	Write a program that opens a file with some number of characters written in it.
 An integer input is taken. If the input is positive, skip those many characters and print the remaining till end of the file. If the input is negative, then print those man y characters till end of the file.
eg., file contents :abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
input number: 15, output: pqrstuvwxyz
input number: -10 , output: qrstuvwxyz
10	Write a program, using structures to read details of n students,with details,ID,name,fathername,date of birth and marks, and write those details to a file, one line per student, each detail separated by a comma. The first record must be a Heading. Open the file with .csv extension.
11	Write a program to read the above file and print who is topper.
12	Assume that there is a file with 0 to 1000 numbers. Take input of two integers, and replace the first integer with next.
Eg., 365 ,563
365 must be replaced everywhere with 563.
13	 WAP to take an input string from the user, and delete the given word n number of times from a file.
Eg., input : world , 5
Find and delete the word “world” in a file 5 times.
14	read numbers entered by user and write to a file. Open the file and read the numbers and write even numbers to even file and odd numbers to odd file.
